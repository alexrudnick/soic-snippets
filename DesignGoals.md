# Simple #

When you log into Snippets (which should be easy), you're presented with a text box and a simple question: What did you do last week?  What are you going to do this week?  That's it.

# Open #

By "open" we mean at least two things:

  * The Snippets system shouldn't be a dead end for data: you should be able to export your snippets if you want, post them via Twitter if you want, have them show up on your blog if you want.

  * Snippets is open source, in the sense that the code is available and in the sense that collaboration is welcome.
