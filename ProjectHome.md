The Snippets project is a simple, lightweight web app for tracking and communicating what you're working on.  It was started by and for students in the <a href='http://www.soic.indiana.edu/'>School of Informatics and Computing</a> at <a href='http://www.iub.edu/'>Indiana University</a>, but is available for use by anyone with an <a href='http://kb.iu.edu/data/beml.html'>IU network ID</a>.  It's currently being hosted at https://www.cs.indiana.edu/cgi-pub/alexr/snippets/.

Snippets is inspired by a system used at Google, in which every week, employees get an email asking them to write down what they did last week and what they plan to do this week.  The resulting "snippets" are browsable, and users have the option of subscribing to people whose work they're interested in knowing about.

Right now, Snippets has only basic functionality: you can enter and view snippets and subscribe to other users.  It doesn't send email yet, and there are likely some bugs!

Want to work on Snippets and make it better?  Usability concerns, bug reports, feature requests and patches are all welcome.  If you'd like to report an issue or request a feature, please use the [issue tracker](http://code.google.com/p/soic-snippets/issues/list).

Snippets is written in Python.  The primary developer has been Alex Rudnick so far, but collaboration is very welcome!  Have a look at the [code](http://code.google.com/p/soic-snippets/source/browse/)!
